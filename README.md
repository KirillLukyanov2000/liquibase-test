##
Liquibase is a database schema change management solution that enables you to revise and release database changes faster and safer from development to production.

##

To start using Liquibase quickly and easily, you can write your migration scripts in SQL.

To take advantage of database abstraction abilities that allow you to write changes once and deploy to different database platforms, you can specify database-agnostic changes in XML, JSON, or YAML.
